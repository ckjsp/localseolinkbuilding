                    Links Farmer provides flexibility on refunds. The Billing department analyzes each request for a refund. Refunds will be made if the service has not been rendered and if the publishing process has not started yet. If the request for a refund comes during the publishing process or after the service has been rendered, it will be denied and payments for services already rendered are non-refundable in any case.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-lg-2">
                    Links Farmer is not accepting refund requests on the following grounds:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p> issues related to partner news websites, or press release aggregation sites and any related platform performance. This includes the unavailability of web pages, website loading speed, hyperlinks, search engine indexing, third-party comments, content layout, and style.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Refund requests for partial months or years of service, requests due to upgrade or downgrade, and refund requests for unused service limits.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>For fairness, no exception will be made to these rules.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pt-lg-2">Customers who feel that the services provided do not align with the description on the website may file complaints with the Links Farmer Support Department. To proceed with the complaint, customers must provide clear evidence demonstrating that the purchased service or product fails to meet the stated description. Complaints based solely on personal expectations or desires will not be honoured. Links Farmer reviews complaints on a case-by-case basis and retains the right to approve or deny complaints at its discretion.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-lg-2">The system fees are not refundable, as processing fees for deposits into the system. These are non-refundable no matter what. The fee paid on the system for processing withdrawals and deposits varies according to the payment method used for depositing. In terms of withdrawals, the same payment method used for depositing has to be used for the same.

                </p>
                <p class="pt-lg-2">For instance, if an order has been rejected or cancelled, the service will automatically issue a refund. If a publisher did not complete an order, this order will be indicated as having been rejected, and then, the buyer will have the chance to get a refund through their wallet in Link Publisher's system. Before accepting an order, one is advised to make thorough checks on all information about the order. On delivery completion, no further claims will be entertained.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-lg-2">There are many instances under which an advertiser may qualify for a refund.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <P>The last shipment is not accepted. Important to note that, once advertisers fail to approve the links within the due time frame, the system automatically approves them. No refund is made available in such cases.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>In cases where the publisher repeatedly fails to meet the advertiser's criteria despite efforts to rectify it.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>In case there are two orders placed due to a mistake.</p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pt-lg-2">Links Farmer Connects always strives to provide the highest quality service. Such errors should be very rare, but if a valid problem has occurred, and a refund is appropriate, then we will refund the payment, minus any transaction fees that the payment gateway levied.

                </p>
                <p class="pt-lg-2">If there is a dispute between the advertiser and publisher regarding the quality of the delivered link, the advertiser may reach out to Links Farmer. We will mediate between the two parties and work towards a solution. The decision made by Links Farmer in such cases will be final and binding on both parties.


                </p>
                <p class="pt-lg-2">At Links Farmer, we continually strive to deliver high-quality customer service. Our dedicated team works towards addressing any issues promptly with the satisfaction of all our customers.
