                            Link farming is nothing but a black hat technique, where business organizations are asked to create a group of website links for other third parties in order to increase their rankings in search engine optimization. Compared to manual outreach, link farms are following automated programs and services, and it have the power to shut down or penalise them in search engines. In recent days, a wide range of business organizations are considering using manual outreach because of link farming shutdown properties. This link farming is widely used in areas where you need not worry about penalties and connected links.

                            When you want to avoid penalties while reaching the expected output in search engine optimization by backing backlinks, you need to consider using manual outreach. As link farming is a black hat tactic to generate backlinks for websites, this manual outreach is acting as a white hat tactic, where you can able to create backlinks without penalties.

                            As you know, the quality of the backlinks plays a vital role, so you need to put your utmost care into generating backlinks. The manual outreach supports a high-quality back link whereas the link farming didn’t support the quality ones. Whenever you are generating backlinks with manual outreach, you are left with an option to choose your partner independently and ensure quality relevance. As link farming follows automated programming, the selection of high quality one is a difficult and tedious process.

                            Another common reason, why you need to go for manual outreach is because of the control in it. Whenever you are generating backlinks under manual outreach, you have the option to control the links that appear and how they look. But this advantage is absent in link farming. As they automated programming, it is quite hard to control back links in link farming.
